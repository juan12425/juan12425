### Hello you! 

Hi! my name’s Juan Quinche. I’m a MERN (+ redux) full stack developer currently living in Bogota, Colombia! I love to develop great projects and work on them until I reach an incredible result.

Besides that, I really like to learn new things and abilities, both in tech and science. Currently, I know different programming languages such as PHP, Python, Julia, Mql5, Javascript, among others. Now, I’m working with those technologies to build web apps and analyze data.
